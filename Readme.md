# A simple example of master-detail grids with editing capabilities


<p>A sample is created as explained in the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument3772">Master-Detail Relationship</a> help topic. In addition, UPDATE commands are generated in SqlDataSource objects attached to the grids and the Enable Editing checkbox is selected in a smart-tag in the designer to create a command column with the Edit link. The sample requires Northwind demo database on a local MS SQL Server (or SQL Express).</p>
